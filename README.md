Using the Java SAX parser (event-based parser), create a Document Object Model (DOM/directed
graph/tree) representation of the data contained in an XML document. The resulting DOM is to contain all the
data that is provided in the XML document and should work for any XML document structure. The parser is
to be a static method on a class that is appropriately named. The parser is to throw exceptions if problems
are encountered.
To test the parser, create a test application that allows the user to use the File Open dialog to select an XML
file that is to be parsed and turned into a DOM. After the DOM is created from the XML, the contents of the
DOM are to be displayed in the UI. How you display the DOM information is up to you. But, whatever
presentation you use should show the contents of the DOM in a way that the user can see the parser works.
